  <div class="item">Hello, I'm Richard Melkonian, I come from a creative background in music. Prior to the pandemic I was freelancing as a composer in theatre film and TV. I've always enjoyed coding and have been experimenting with Javascript, HTML and CSS since about 2018. I first got into coding by making simple programmes in C++ to assist me with my musical compositions. <br><br>My learning has been very scattered as its mainly been a hobby for me so far. However, I'd like to now take a deep dive into beginning a career as a developer. I'd like to apply with Founders and Coders as the programme aligns well with my core values. Also check out this little blackjack game I made <a href="https://github.com/rvmelkonian/blackjack"> here</a> with a custom UI. I find coding very rewarding and would really love to be part of a learning team, help others, learn from others and be part of Founders and Coders.</div>
